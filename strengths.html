          <p style="color: #777;">Based on a Gallup Strengths Finder exam, Marissa scored highest in these categories.</p>

          <p style="color: #545454; margin: 0; font-size: 16px"><b>Adaptability:</b></p>
          <p style="color: #545454;">
            Chances are good that you allow events to unfold. You have the good sense to be flexible and accept change as it occurs. This explains why your friends often describe you as unflappable — that is, not easily excited. Instinctively, you avoid individuals who work non-stop, never taking a break. You refuse to rush headlong from one activity to the next. You are quite comfortable dealing with change, surprises, and unexpected problems. Why? While you appreciate schedules and plans, you recognize when it is wise to deviate — that is, turn away — from them. Driven by your talents, you are a free spirit who is seldom thrown off balance by unexpected events and comments. Instead, you react to things as they occur. You are quite comfortable letting your future unfold at its own pace. By nature, you surround yourself with lovely things. These have the power to soothe, calm, energize, and inspire you. The arts or nature itself enhances your sense of well-being. You probably pay attention to your environment because you choose to live each moment to its fullest. It’s very likely that you allow events to unfold. You have the good sense to be flexible and accept change as it occurs. 
          </p>
          <p style="color: #545454; margin: 0; font-size: 16px"><b>Achiever:</b></p>
          <p style="color: #545454;">
            Instinctively, you toil with little rest and enjoy it as long as you can partner with individuals who share your strong work ethic. Having slackers in the group certainly tries your patience, especially when they are content to meet the minimum expectations. Your drive to do more and better work undoubtedly annoys and even threatens them. Chances are good that you spend hours unraveling the mysteries of complicated procedures, routines, or systems. Your step-by-step descriptions help numerous individuals understand how things operate. Driven by your talents, you often go out of your way to stay informed about newsworthy topics. Numerous people probably count on you to tell them about information updates, due dates, meeting changes, or special assignments. By nature, you tend to be quite selective about the company you keep. You prefer to spend time with individuals who are trustworthy. You consciously avoid people whose words and deeds indicate they value honesty less than you do. Because of your strengths, you have the extra energy to work hard whenever you are acquiring information to broaden your base of knowledge. You desire to deepen your understanding of various topics, opportunities, problems, solutions, situations, events, or people.  
          </p>
          <p style="color: #545454; margin: 0; font-size: 16px"><b>Futuristic:</b></p>
          <p style="color: #545454;">
            Instinctively, you are a visionary thinker. Your vivid mental images of the coming months, years, or decades often impel you to move into action. Chances are good that you have an ability to imagine what visionaries believe is possible as you read about their innovative ideas and plans. The information you acquire generally frees you to make a mental leap from this moment in time to the future that these thinkers see. Driven by your talents, you intentionally take steps to be the mastermind of your own future. You refuse to leave your destiny to chance. You probably resist placing it in someone else’s hands. You trust your own intelligence and imagination when setting a direction for your life. Because of your strengths, you are eager to get started on a project once you realize what you can accomplish in the coming weeks, months, or years. You work very hard to breathe life into your big dreams. These often push and pull you into the future. It’s very likely that you think a lot about the coming months, years, or decades. You gravitate to projects and study subjects that promise to shape the future. You enjoy talking about possibilities that exist only in your imagination. You probably worry about being left behind if what you know and do were no longer valued or needed. You prefer to be a pioneer and an inventor.  
          </p>
          <p style="color: #545454; margin: 0; font-size: 16px"><b>Learner:</b></p>
          <p style="color: #545454;">
            Because of your strengths, you make sure you comprehend more than any of your opponents do about what it takes to win something. Whenever your results are going to be compared to those of others, you are determined to be the sole victor. Consequently, you welcome opportunities to put your talents, knowledge, and skills to the test. You are especially interested when meaningful and objective measurements are used to pinpoint the best performer. Instinctively, you naturally harbor feelings of good will toward almost everyone you meet. From the start, you probably pose questions that reveal to you another person’s strengths, interests, or goals. Knowing as much as you do about an individual allows you to appreciate him or her more than others can. People often turn to you for insights about strangers or newcomers to the group. Your knowledge usually helps them to accept these outsiders sooner rather than later. Chances are good that you treasure books and other publications because they are rich sources of information. You regard the printed word as a gateway to a vast world of new ideas. Your quest to interpret events, grasp facts, or understand concepts appears limitless. Frequently you read to broaden your perspective on very familiar, as well as altogether unfamiliar, topics. Driven by your talents, you fill your mind with new ideas by asking questions, reading, studying, observing, or listening. Normally, you accumulate facts, data, stories, examples, or background information from the people you meet. Determining what they want to accomplish in the coming weeks, months, or years generally satisfies your curiosity. These insights also allow you to understand why individuals behave the way they do in different situations. By nature, you habitually bring together all sorts of information so you can refer to it later. At the instant you collect a fact, example, story, or piece of data, typically you are eager to use it. You trust it is valuable. Your fascination with knowledge has probably been part of you even before you formed the words to ask your first question.  
          </p>
          <p style="color: #545454; margin: 0; font-size: 16px"><b>Intellection:</b></p>
          <p style="color: #545454;">
            By nature, you are attracted to the printed word. Each discovery raises new questions. Each insight enables you to forge linkages between facts, statements, events, or data. The more you read, the more you know — but the more you know, the more you realize what else you need to know. Through reading, you acquire knowledge and gain new skills. You feel happy when you are blossoming — that is, coming into your own. Because of your strengths, you read to stimulate your mind, to broaden your perspective, and to explore familiar as well as unfamiliar subjects. Reading is a solitary activity, which is one of the reasons why you like it so much. You are quite comfortable being alone with your books and your thoughts. Chances are good that you designate a minimum of five hours a week for solitary thinking. You probably have figured out how to eliminate distractions and interruptions. You accept the fact that you have less free time to spend with family, friends, coworkers, teammates, or classmates. It’s very likely that you characteristically read books, periodicals, documents, correspondence, or Internet sites. You are willing to be mentally stimulated by thought-provoking ideas, information, data, predictions, insights, characters, or plots. Driven by your talents, you read to acquire new information or to collect insights about unique discoveries, events, or people. Characteristically you conduct an in- depth examination of a subject. Your curiosity is not easily satisfied. Frequently you rely on books, publications, or printed materials to deepen your understanding of the topic.

          <p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: small">I am currently attending Chapman University to pursue a career in Speech-Language Pathology. The Post-Baccalaureate program will conclude in November and I will begin my Speech Language Pathologist Assistant clinical hours shortly after. I have been fortunate enough to work with a broad-range of ages, including students that are on the spectrum. I presently work at an Early Intervention program in Lawndale, CA. I get to work with the babies (18 months – 3 years old)! I am enjoying every minute and experience I encounter and can’t wait to continue working with kids with speech and language impairments.<br>
          <br>
          I am an LA native who loves mockumentary television shows and silly comedies. I like to hit the gym, read fictional novels and hang out at random coffee shops during my spare time. Feel free to contact me.</p>
