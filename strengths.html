          <p style="color: #545454;">

From the start, you probably pose questions that reveal to you another person’s strengths, interests, or goals. Knowing as much as you do about an individual allows you to appreciate him or her more than others can. People often turn to you for insights about strangers or newcomers to the group. Your knowledge usually helps them to accept these outsiders sooner rather than later. Chances are good that you treasure books and other publications because they are rich sources of information. You regard the printed word as a gateway to a vast world of new ideas. Your quest to interpret events, grasp facts, or understand concepts appears limitless. Frequently you read to broaden your perspective on very familiar, as well as altogether unfamiliar, topics.

            By nature, you are attracted to the printed word. Each discovery raises new questions. Each insight enables you to forge linkages between facts, statements, events, or data.

You feel happy when you are blossoming — that is, coming into your own. Because of your strengths, you read to stimulate your mind, to broaden your perspective, and to explore familiar as well as unfamiliar subjects.

Chances are good that you designate a minimum of five hours a week for solitary thinking. You probably have figured out how to eliminate distractions and interruptions. You accept the fact that you have less free time to spend with family, friends, coworkers, teammates, or classmates. It’s very likely that you characteristically read books, periodicals, documents, correspondence, or Internet sites.
